            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p class="story-paragraph">
              In the heart of a bustling school, a young man named Awan found
              himself struggling with his studies. His grades were slipping, and
              he felt lost amidst the sea of knowledge. That’s when he met her -
              a girl named Cery. Cery was a bright student, known for her
              intellect and kindness. She noticed Awan’s struggles and offered
              to help him. Awan, initially hesitant, agreed to accept her
              assistance. Their study sessions started in the school library,
              amidst the quiet rustle of turning pages and hushed whispers. As
              time passed, Awan found himself not only improving in his studies
              but also looking forward to their study sessions. Cery’s patience
              and understanding made learning enjoyable. He admired her passion
              for knowledge and her dedication to helping him. Cery, on the
              other hand, found herself drawn to Awan’s determination to
              improve. His gratitude and respect towards her were evident in his
              actions. She admired his resilience and his willingness to learn.
              Their shared moments in the library soon turned into shared
              lunches, shared laughter, and shared secrets. Amidst the academic
              pressure and school chaos, they found solace in each other’s
              company.
